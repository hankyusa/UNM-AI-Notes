# UNM AI Notes

The notes are being typed up in markdown with LaTex equations denoted with '$' signs. I converted them to HTML and then printed that to PDF. I'm including all products.

Contributions welcome.

The numbers in parentheses in the level 2 headers are the lecture numbers from the [Berkeley Recommended Lecture Videos](http://ai.berkeley.edu/lecture_videos.html).
